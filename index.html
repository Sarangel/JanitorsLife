<p>This page will tell you about the steps on becoming a janitor, and also make 
people very satisfy with your work.</p>

<a id="Becoming a Janitor" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Becoming a Janitor</h3>

<p>To become a janitor you must have low skills but only cleaning skills and please do not think this as sort of a maid or housecleaning type of job.
Just becuse you have the skills doesnt mean you're good at the job.

<p>If you prefer to use a simple plunger BE CAREFUL!! Not everyone can handle the power that lies within the plunger Many have failed and only few have ever found success. One man named Mr.Tony was the first to ever find the power within the plunger and 
he was also janitor of the month, if you want to become a better janitor, just follow his example.</p>

<a id="Duties" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it means to become a legendary Janitor</h3>

<p> A person who cleans and maintains buildings such as hospitals, schools and residential accommodation. Janitors' primary responsibility is as a cleaner. In some cases they will also carry out maintenance and security duties. A similar position, but usually with more managerial duties and not including cleaning, is occupied by building superintendents in the United States. Cleaning is one of the most commonly outsourced services. Janitorial companies have a tendency to employ undocumented workers. The janitor has become a negatively stereotypical Black or blue collar character in popular culture.
  Another thing to look out for is our Janitors Hall of Fame (don't really have one, sorry)
